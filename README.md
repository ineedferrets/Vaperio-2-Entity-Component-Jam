# Vaperio 2 by Joe Hesketh and Peter York
Made during the 2021 Global Game Jam, Vaperio 2 is a bullet hell utilising Unity's Entity Component System to draw as many entities as possible. The aim is to fight multiple enemies with Boid behaviours.

## Gameplay
Vaperio is a bullet hell that pits you against endless waves of enemies. You move with WASD and fire with space. You also can change your perspective 

## Project Notes
This project was uploaded after the jam by myself so the project statistics will say all lines of code are purely pushed by myself. This isn't true and the input by myself and Peter York were equal.
